# How does a map work?

Sometimes, as a developer, you want to store key-value pairs. For example you may want to access a user object by its username. The best suited data structure for this is a **map**. It allows us to get a value by its unique key in `O(1)`. If you are not familiar with the Big-O notation, check out [my article]() about it.

Let's take the simplest map you can think of: an array! It stores key-value pairs, but the keys are limited to natural integers only. As we all know random array access is `O(1)`. But why?

In memory an array is one **continuous** block of memory. You additionally have to know where the array starts in memory and how big the individual elements are. To access a random element, you simply take the index, multiply it with the element size (assuming a uniform element size) and add the start address of the array:
```
memory_location_to_fetch = index * size_of_single_element + start_of_array
```
<!-- Pseudocode or valid c style hmm -->

# Hashing

Ok, but what if we want to use strings to index our elements? Here we will use a technique called _hashing_. A hashing function takes an input of **arbitrary** length and produces a deterministic output of **fixed** length. This is often accomplished by the modulo operator.

```
hash(x) = f(x) â„… size_of_map
```
`f(x)` is some arbitrary function that is dependent on the implementation. The easiest function would be the *identity*: `f(x) = x`.

And what about strings as keys? Or objects?

# Everything is an integer

If we go back to the computer memory, everything is stored in binary. But nothing prevents you from *interpreting* that binary as a normal integer. Let's use a simple string as example. C-strings are just the ASCII characters in one continuous chunk of memory suffixed with a zero byte. To convert from (binary-)number to ASCII, the [ASCII table](http://www.asciitable.com/) is used. For example we will translate the string `Hello` into its number representation (in hex here, because it's easier to translate to binary than decimal):
```
 H     e     l     l     o     \0
0x48  0x65  0x6C  0x6C  0x6F  0x00
```
We can now simply interpret these 6 bytes as one number, and we can use this number as an input for our hash function.

# Hash collisions

As you might have already asked yourself, what happens if two different values get hashed to the same result? For example, we have a map of size `10` and put in `0`, `10`, `20`, and so on?

For this we can implement an avoidance strategy:
- Linear hashing: If spot is already occupied, alter the new value by a fixed amount (often 1)
- Double Hashing: We simply hash our hash and put our element there
- Using a linked list as array elements and appending collisions. This effectively gives us "buckets" filled with objects which have the same hash value.

# Bringing it all together

We will now implement a map that first will only work for integers. I will be using `TypeScript` for the example code here, if you have not heard about it check it out - its pretty cool.

As we have already seen we can represent every type as integer, so we can add other types later.

First what we actually store inside our map:
```ts
class OurMap<Value> {
    private array: [number, Value][];

    constructor(size: number) {
        this.array = new Array(size);
    }
}
```
We just define an array of a fixed length that stores our key-value pairs.

Now we add an `insert` method:
```ts
class OurMap<Value> {
    private array: [number, Value][];

    constructor(size: number) {
        this.array = new Array(size);
    }

    public insert(key: number, value: Value) {
        const origIndex = this.hash(key);
        let index = origIndex;
	while(this.array[index] !== undefined
	  && this.array[index][0] !== key) {
	    index = (index + 1) % this.array.length;
            if(index === origIndex) {
	        throw new Error('Map is already full');
	    }
	}
	this.array[index] = [key, value];
    }
}
```
Can you see what collision avoidance strategy we have used? If you said linear hashing, you are right! If our spot is already occupied, we go one to the right. 

The `get` method works exactly the same as the insert method, it just doesn't check for `undefined` but for the key you passed in.

Deletion is also similar, but we additionally have to check for elements on the right. If there is an element it might have got there by our linear hashing so if the original element is missing the `get` will not try to look at the right. We have to shift those elements back to the left. This, of course, could lead to further corrections.

# Bonus round: Sets

You might have also stumbled across **sets**. As it turns out, you can implement a set with a map. You can actually see this in the Development Tools of Google Chrome! A set has the properties keys and values, which would not make sense for a set where you only need keys for example. <!--- Please clarify this sentence -->

Let's copy that approach by simply using our keys as values.
```ts
class OurSet {
    private map: OurMap<number>;

    constructor(size: number) {
        this.map = new OurMap<number>(size);
    }

    public insert(value: number) {
        this.map.insert(value, value);
    }
}
```

This works because using the same key will always lead to the same memory location. So if there is already the key you overwrite it which doesn't change anything. If there is no entry you can know that this key does not yet exists in the set.

<!--- Maybe add a nice finishing thought or a lookout on whats to come -->
<!--- Also consider talking about bucket hashing -->
<!--- Definitely compare complexity in space and time for insert/get/remove for map--array--singlelist, maybe chapter "Tradeoffs"-->
